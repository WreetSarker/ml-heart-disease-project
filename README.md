# ml-heart-disease-project

### This is a machine learning project on the UCI heart disease dataset. Here I have used ** Logistic Regression **, **Random Forest Classification ** and **KNeighbors Classification** models on the data set. After tuning the hyperparameters of the dataset, logistic regression model came out as the best model in the metrics evaluation process.
I have used the following approach in the process:
* Problem Definition -> * Data Collection and Analysis -> * Evaluation -> * Feature Analysis -> * Modelling and finally Experimentation

Language and Libraries used:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Numpy
5. Scikit-learn
